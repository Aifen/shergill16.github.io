<p> Canada's joint bid to host the 2026 World Cup is running into stiff opposition from Morocco.</p>
<p>ESPN reports the African nation appears to be the front-runner over the North American bid of Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.</p>
<p>With voting coming up just before the World Cup begins on June 14, there are doubts the North American bid will get the votes needed to win out over Morocco.</p>
<p>Late bids can come in before March 14, but for now, it's North America and Morocco, and according to ESPN, one source has Africa, parts of Asia and South America going for Morocco, so the North American bid would need to counter with parts of Europe, parts of Asia and Oceania in its corner.</p>

<p>ROME -- AC Milan's unbeaten streak in all competitions reached 13 matches with a 5-4 penalty shootout victory over Lazio on Wednesday to advance to the Coppa Italia final against Juventus.</p>
<p>After Lazio's Luiz Felipe Ramos placed his penalty attempt high over the bar, Milan centre-back Alessio Romagnoli -- who grew up as a Lazio fan -- calmly drilled his decisive shot into the left corner to seal the win.</p>
<p>The game ended 0-0 after extra time, following a scoreless first leg as well.</p>

<h1>Match report: Villanova 3-2 Bethlehem Steel FC</h1>

<p>Following a 2-0 clean sheet victory over Chris Nanco’s alma mater Syracuse on the 24th, Bethlehem Steel FC traveled to the mainline Saturday, where their midfield struggled against Villanova losing 3-2. Villanova was the second of three college teams on their preseason schedule – Maryland 3/6.</p>
<p>Steel FC looked flat from the opening kick. Fitness was a problem for many players which may not be surprising, as the club was playing their third match in just eight days. Villanova created more chances overall with 12 shots total, eight on frame. Steel FC registered just six on frame all day.</p>
<p>Bethlehem’s A.J. Paterson saw a lot of the ball. He is definitely a player who enjoys his touches and thrives being on the ball consistently. He scored his first goal with his forehead off the right foot of Nanco. Off a short corner, Steel FC executed a training ground play to perfection when Nanco received a return ball off the short corner and delivered a beautiful ball into Paterson. In the last minute of the match, forward Aidan Apodaca notched his third preseason goal. Apodaca finds the net often it seems.</p>
